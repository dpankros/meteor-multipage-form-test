MultiPage-Form test
===================

Simple test for the meteor dpankros:multipage-form package.

Some parts of this example can be made simpler, but I've tried to make things  explicit for the benefit of anyone trying to integrate the package.  Please feel free to suggest improvements to the package.

I built this because I had specific requirements that were not met by existing packages.  I'd love to hear if you find it useful.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the source
2. Add required packages: 
```
meteor add aldeed:autoform
meteor add aldeed:simple-schema
meteor add twbs:bootstrap
meteor add dpankros:multipage-form
```
3. Run! 
```
meteor
```
